# ScratchMind

**Understanding Machine Learning by Building It From First Principles.**

ScratchMind is a growing, open research-and-learning ecosystem focused on *re-deriving*, *re-implementing*, and *re-explaining* machine learning systems from scratch — without shortcuts, hidden abstractions, or blind reliance on libraries.

The goal is not speed.  
The goal is **clarity**.

## Philosophy

Modern ML education often jumps straight to frameworks, APIs, and benchmarks.  
ScratchMind takes the opposite path.

We believe that:
- True understanding comes from *reconstruction*
- Implementation sharpens theory
- Teaching is a form of verification
- Systems thinking matters more than isolated tricks

Every project here starts with a simple question:

> *Why does this exist — and how would I build it if nothing existed already?*

## The ScratchMind Ecosystem

ScratchMind is organized as a set of focused repositories, each exploring a specific axis of machine learning.

### 🧠 Core Projects

- **[ScratchVision](https://github.com/ScratchMind/ScratchVision)**  
  Vision models from first principles — from MLPs and convolutional ideas to biologically inspired architectures.

- **[ScratchGen](https://github.com/ScratchMind/ScratchGen)**  
  Generative modeling explored bottom-up: probability, likelihoods, latent variables, and generative processes.

- **ScratchSeq (Coming Soon)**  
  Sequential reasoning, temporal models, and the evolution from recurrence to attention.

Each repository is **self-contained**, with:
- conceptual notes
- from-scratch implementations
- experiments and reflections
- links back to theory and motivation

## Writing & Build-in-Public

Alongside code, ScratchMind emphasizes **documentation as a first-class artifact**.

Writing serves three purposes:
1. Revisit and refine understanding  
2. Expose gaps honestly  
3. Create reusable mental models for others  

Blog posts and notes are linked directly from the repositories and may live as:
- Markdown documents
- GitHub READMEs
- External articles (Medium, GitHub Pages)

> The code explains *how*.  
> The writing explains *why*.

## What This Is (and Is Not)

**This is:**
- deliberate, slow learning
- principled re-implementation
- systems-oriented ML thinking
- an evolving public notebook

**This is not:**
- a framework
- a tutorial dump
- a benchmark race
- production ML advice

---

## Navigation

- Start with any repository README
- Follow links from notes → code → experiments
- Use this page as the ecosystem map

There is no required order.

## Closing Note

ScratchMind is intentionally unfinished.

Understanding is iterative.  
Clarity compounds.

If something feels slow here, that is by design.
